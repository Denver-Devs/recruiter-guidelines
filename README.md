Guidelines for recruiter posting in the Denver Devs Slack 

## Do's
* Be humble -- developers have the ability/incentive to work with each other to get hired, but we're happy to give you that money
* Mentor -- developers who are new don't always know the ropes, and you can create a great reputation by introducing people in healthy and productive ways
* Develop your own career -- the more specific you get with the technology and learning the trends, the better you'll be able to match up opportunities and talent
* Network people -- recruitment doesn't always have to be about the hire, and developers should work with you more if you connect them when they need it since you are a "gatekeeper"
* Make it profitible -- you aren't doing these services for free, but be creative about convincing people to work with you
* Host and sponsor community events -- this is a great way to make your presence known as a support to the community
* Promote diversity of identity and thought and good industry principles -- you should convince hiring managers if they need convincing how this will improve their bottom line

## Don'ts
* "Sell" -- good engineers are trained in the art of circumventing bull, and it's in your interest for your recruits to be "good"
* Promote negative industry patterns -- free "sugary" foods, beer, or any other unhealthy thing that seasoned people see through to demand more working hours
* Pretend contract-to-hire typically converts to full-time -- it usually doesn't, so don't lie
* Over-emphasize "cutting-edge" -- a ten year old company using technology from the last three years really doesn't count
* Make anyone sign an NDA with you or exclusivity -- if you do this, you will be shamed out of the Denver metro area
* Involve yourself in engineering politics -- the status quo today is usually not the money maker tomorrow so it's not always to your benefit to do exactly what the client/HM wants
