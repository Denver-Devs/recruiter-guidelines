# Recruiter Guidelines
A few tips, tricks, and some rules for recruiters when posting to Denver Devs Slack or Discourse. 

## Do's
* Be humble -- developers have the ability/incentive to work with each other to get hired, but we're happy to give you that money
* Mentor -- developers who are new don't always know the ropes, and you can create a great reputation by introducing people in healthy and productive ways
* Develop your own career -- the more specific you get with the technology and learning the trends, the better you'll be able to match up opportunities and talent
* Network people -- recruitment doesn't always have to be about the hire, and developers should work with you more if you connect them when they need it since you are a "gatekeeper"
* Make it profitible -- you aren't doing these services for free, but be creative about convincing people to work with you
* Host and sponsor community events -- this is a great way to make your presence known as a support to the community
* Promote diversity of identity and thought and good industry principles -- you should convince hiring managers if they need convincing how this will improve their bottom line

## Don'ts
* "Sell" -- good engineers are trained in the art of circumventing bull, and it's in your interest for your recruits to be "good"
* Promote negative industry patterns -- free "sugary" foods, beer, or any other unhealthy thing that seasoned people see through to demand more working hours
* Pretend contract-to-hire typically converts to full-time -- it usually doesn't, so don't lie
* Over-emphasize "cutting-edge" -- a ten year old company using technology from the last three years really doesn't count
* Make anyone sign an NDA with you or exclusivity -- if you do this, you will be shamed out of the Denver metro area
* Involve yourself in engineering politics -- the status quo today is usually not the money maker tomorrow so it's not always to your benefit to do exactly what the client/HM wants

## Definitely don't do these:
* Spam -- Posting more than once a day, or posting the same thing every day, will get your posts deleted. Let your posts breathe. 
* Compete -- We know recruiting is your job, don't try to out-post / out compete other recruiters in the channel. It's gross. 
* Get off topic -- Keep gig openings to #topic-gigs only. 
* DM members (unless they say you can) -- Don't engage in private conversations with members unless their post explicitly states something about DM'ing them, or unless they've given you permission to do so before. This is our happy space.
